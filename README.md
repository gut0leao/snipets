## Windows Batch

* [**Swap Network Interfaces:**](https://github.com/gut0leao/snipets/blob/master/windows_batch/swap_network_interfaces.bat)
This .bat file switches the enable/disable states between two netcards on Windows. Useful in the folow situation: You have two network interfaces on yout machine and one is connected to business ethernet and other to your personal internet link (your 4G mobile internet, for example) and you want to switch between then with just one click.
Tested in Windows 10, update KB4530684.
